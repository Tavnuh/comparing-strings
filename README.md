# Comparing Strings - Levenshtein Distance and Cosine Similarity

Credit: Built on top of the work of Dario Radecic in [Calculating String Similarity](https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-string-similarity-in-python-276e18a7d33a)

A short notebook containing a function and examples of Levenshtein Distance and Cosine Similarity
- Levenshtein Distance - Returns a number that expresses the number of single unit character changes required to get from one string to another. The function specifically cleans email address and name strings, and compares them, returning a value for how many changes would be required. The intention is to use this as a feature in a machine learning model for fraud prevention.
- Cosine Similarity - Returns a value for how "similar" two sentences are.
